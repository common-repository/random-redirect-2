This is an expansion of Matt Mullenweg's original Random Redirect plugin.

== Description ==
This is an expansion of Matt Mullenweg's original Random Redirect plugin which allowed you to create a link to link to yourblog.example.com/?random which would redirect the visitor to a random post or page on your website in a manner similar to StumbleUpon.  Matt's original plugin also allowed you to limit the randomness to specific categories and post/page status.

We have taken the original plugin a step further, with Random Redirect 2 you can specify `random_tag_id` or `random_year` or `random_month` or `random_keyword` too, giving you fine grained control of the level of randomness.  In addition to the extra parameters, you can also combine parameters!
